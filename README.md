## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite applications & their features:
1. Discord - real time voice and text chat, channel organization, cutomization and bots
2. Spotify - personalized recommendations, offline listening, cross-device syncing
3. Digital Color Meter - precision color picking, live preview, lightweight and fast

Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not committing to this idea, but it helps to start brainstorming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

I’d like to build an app called “StudyNest”, a minimal and calming productivity tool designed for students who struggle with staying focused. The app would combine a simple pomodoro timer, ambient background sounds (like rain, cafés, or white noise), and a visual progress tracker that lets users “build” their own digital cozy study space as they complete tasks. Each session adds elements to their virtual room (like books, plants, or lights), creating a light gamification effect without being distracting. I’d also include a task list, gentle reminders, and a lockout feature that blocks distracting apps while the timer runs. It's meant to be motivating, aesthetic, and distraction-free — a soft push toward better habits.


## Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

As a first-time user of Xcode, getting started with this project was a bit challenging. I had no prior experience with the environment, so it took some time to get comfortable navigating the interface and understanding how to use the available tools effectively. Figuring out how to set up the project, place UI elements, and connect them with Swift code required patience and experimentation. However, as I spent more time exploring and building, I gradually became more confident using Xcode and started to appreciate how powerful it is for app development.
